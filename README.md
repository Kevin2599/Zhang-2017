Code for the paper "Comments on computation of the gravity field and its gradient" in Computers and Geosciences 2017

By Zhang Dailei and Huang Danian, College of Geo-Exploration Science and Technology, Jilin University, China. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code is written and complied in MATLAB R2015a. It is used to calculate the gravity and gravity gradient anomalies a vertical 
cylinder. As there is not a full set of modelling mathematical expressions of vertical cylinder, we calculate Tzz firstly and
get the other components of gradient tensors and gravity anomaly through transforming in frequency domain. For the details of the
code, please read the attached M file and as well as the called functions. For the mathematical formulas and parameters of the
models, please have a look at the paper. 

For more information about this code and if you have any enquiries or advices, please do not hesitate to contact us.
